        <h1>About Dan Payne</h1>
        <p>In 2000, I completed my Electronics Engineering Technology degree at DeVry University and after working for Boeing Satellite Systems and for REMEC/Cobham designing flight/space hardware, I became restless as I realized I preferred working with code.</p>
        <p>I began self-schooling on web development concepts and in 2007 I began working with Spiegel Design Group (SDG) as the sole backend developer. Over the years we grew the company, working with clients such as The Drybar, IT Cosmetics, ReserveBar, simplehuman, Korn Ferry, and many others. As the team grew, my role became more managerial as I ran the day-to-day operations of the company, but I continued to contribute as a developer as needed.</p>
        <p>After leaving SDG I realized that my years of experience as a developer would give me a solid foundation in the rapidly emerging web accessibility field. I trained for and passed the IAAP WAS certification exam recently and now continue to develop and grow my skills in evaluating website accessibility.</p>
